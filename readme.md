# PHP .CSV File Processor

The idea is to create a small application which can take a csv file and create an html table from it using PHP.

Goals:

- To be done using OOP methods.
- Ability to add columns with calculated information.
  - One request requires getting a real time conversion rate for currencies.
- Easily able to handle adding new column creation functions for new column types.
- Ability to ouput a summary row for columns.

- Ideally as little iteration as possible on the CSV and resulting table, as they could be quite large.
- ..Ideally don't have to sign up somewhere for an API key...
